#Feed Reader Testing
##Description
This project was part of the Udacity Nanodegree and was designed to test the concepts
covered in the JavaScript Testing course. The student was given an application that
reads RSS feeds and was asked to write Jasmine tests for that application. When run, the
application will show the results of those tests.
